Columns in order 

 subjectId        
 	Numeric
 	Unique identify of subject for the observation
 	Between 1 and 30.
 	
 activity                 
 	String
 	Text identifier of the activity for the observation
 	One of "LAYING","SITTING","STANDING","WALKING","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
 	
The remaining columns represent the average means and standard deviations across a given subjectId for all intances of the named activity. Where measurements are spatial, X, Y, and Z coordinates are listed seprately (with suffixes denoting the different coordinates). "mean" in the column name indicates the value is an average mean. "std" in the column name indicates the value is an average standard deviation.
